[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Cohen's D: -0.0886

If you graph the two distributions side by side in a histogram, the 
count of babies with a higher totalwgt_lb is higher for others when
compared to first borns.  This could be contributed to the fact that 
there are more "other" babies in the sample (4675 other babies vs 4363 
first born babies.) Soley looking at the average weight of the babies, 
you could say that babies born after the first baby weigh more. However
With a small effect size, it is hard to conclusively make a statement. 

Please let me know if you would like to see the code associated with
this work.
